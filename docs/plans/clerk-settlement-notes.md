# Workstream C — clerk/settlement tracking notes

Working notes for the clerk-settlement branch (federation-showcase.md
Track S: G6 → S1 → S2 → S4 → S5 → S6). Not a design doc — a running
record of decisions and deferred work whose rationale doesn't belong in
code comments.

## G6 — Raft caller-identity gate (RESOLVED: node-peer grants are the pattern)

**Question.** A `clerk-ledger` runs `Consistency::Raft` across a bank's
nodes; its money-path mutators are `#[msg(role = Operator)]`. When such a
mutator reaches the Raft leader from another node — either a follower's
in-process agent auto-forwarding a refused write
(`agent_forward_to_raft_leader`, `vos/src/node.rs`) or any cross-node
invoke — the leader attributes the caller to the **forwarding/peer node's
PeerId**. The in-process `Caller::System` / `Caller::Actor` identity that
bypasses role gates is *lost* the moment the invoke leaves the node. So:
does the existing node-peer grant path satisfy the Operator gate, or is a
new mechanism (a System-relayed forward) required?

**Answer: node-peer grants work; no new mechanism.** The leader resolves
the caller's space role from its **local** space-registry
(`lookup_caller_role` → `peer_role`). Granting the voter node's own PeerId
`AUTH_ROLE_ADMIN` (space `Admin`, which the `CLERK_LEDGER_SPACE_ROLE_MAP`
maps to `ClerkLedgerRole::Operator`) makes the forwarded/cross-node write
pass. `AUTH_ROLE_DEVELOPER` would also map to `Operator`; `Member` would
not. This is the "chronos lesson" already documented at
`vos/src/node.rs`'s `agent_forward_to_raft_leader`.

Proven by `raft_clerk_ledger_operator_gate_under_leader_forward`
(`vos/tests/elf_integration.rs`): ungranted node peer → `Forbidden`;
granted node peer → `bootstrap`/`create_account`/`apply_transfer` commit
through the leader and both replicas converge on one state root; a
follower restart re-converges.

**Consequences this shapes:**

- **Manifests (S5).** `clerk-ledger` is `consistency = "raft"`. The
  space-registry that resolves the grant must be **CRDT-replicated across
  the bank's nodes** so the grant is present on whichever node holds
  leadership. (The grant is anchored on one node and converges; the test
  asserts convergence on both replicas before driving the gated writes.)
- **Grant script (E/S7).** Grant **every voter node's own peer**
  `Admin` on the bank's space — not only the operator's CLI peer. A write
  that lands on / forwards through a node authenticates as *that node's*
  peer.
- **clerk-settle (S1).** `register_bank` / `settle_window` are
  Operator-gated on a Raft venue and inherit the same rule. The demo
  targets the venue **leader** directly for these (via `raft-status`), but
  the venue's node peers must still be granted `Admin` so a co-located
  agent's forward (or a leadership flip mid-call) doesn't strand the write.
  `submit_claim` stays an OPEN handler (auth = the bank's claim signature),
  so it is unaffected.

## Handler arg typing (G25 status)

G25 (custom rkyv structs as `#[msg]` args) has **not** landed on master as
of the branch point (`macros-typed-args` sits at the same commit as
master). New handlers on `clerk-settle` and `clerk-bridge` are therefore
written in the `Vec<u8>` + manual-decode idiom, matching the existing
clerk actors.

**Retype TODO (after G25 lands):** replace the `Vec<u8>` args below with
typed rkyv structs / `[u8; N]` and drop the `try_array`/`from_bytes`-style
decoding.

- `clerk-settle` (`actors/clerk-settle/src/lib.rs` + `store.rs`):
  `register_bank(name, clerk_pubkey)` → `clerk_pubkey: [u8; 32]`;
  `submit_claim(claim, voucher_count, rk_set_hash)` → `rk_set_hash: [u8; 32]`
  (claim stays opaque bytes — it's a foreign `SettlementClaim` wire form);
  `settle_window` / `settlement_status` / `claim_diagnostics` bank names stay
  `Vec<u8>` (opaque), the `claimant`/`peer` args → `[u8; 32]`. `ClaimReport`
  is already a typed rkyv return.

## Progress

- **G6** — done, committed. Raft caller-identity gate proven.
- **S1** — done. `actors/clerk-settle` crate (venue actor): `register_bank`
  (Operator), `submit_claim` (open, claim-signature-authed), `settle_window`
  (Operator) → `cipher_clerk::settlement::reconcile`; claim store
  replace-until-settled + freeze-on-settle with a version byte; watch-view
  reads. 8 in-crate unit tests + `raft_clerk_settle_bilateral_settlement`
  e2e (venue Raft ×2, Operator handlers via leader-forward + node-peer
  grant, open `submit_claim` via follower, bilateral zero-sum settle,
  replication convergence). cipher-clerk `settlement` feature enabled for
  this crate only.
- **S2** — done. clerk-bridge receiver-term accumulation: per-`(peer,
  currency, window)` negated sum of accepted vouchers' `amount_commit`,
  folded at the same accept points as the F2 anchor (both `submit_voucher`
  and `redeem_voucher`); `window_rotate(peer)` (Operator) + `current_window`
  + `window_net(peer, currency, window)` reads. Currency = fixed
  `DEMO_CURRENCY = 840` (register_peer's ABI kept stable — a per-peer
  currency param is the multi-currency forward step). Point arithmetic uses
  only `Amount::to_point`/`from_point` (no `curve25519` direct dep, no
  `settlement` feature on the bridge). The normative worked example is
  `window::tests::worked_example_two_bank_net_flows_cancel`; the two-bank
  e2e now asserts `window_net` == negated accepted commit end-to-end.
  clerk-bridge gained a roles module (Operator gate) for `window_rotate`
  (and S4's `anchor_reset`).

  **Currency decision:** the accumulator key carries currency from the
  start, but `register_peer` stays 3-arg (`peer_name, clerk_pubkey,
  node_prefix`) — the demo is single-currency, and its two existing callers
  (the two-bank e2e) stay untouched. Revisit if multi-currency federation
  is added: add `currency: u32` to `register_peer` → `PeerEntry`.
- **S4** — done. `anchor_reset(peer, root)` (Operator) on clerk-bridge:
  re-anchors `last_root_after` to a settled window's closing root, the
  sanctioned recovery for the F2 fail-closed wedge. Two-bank e2e now proves
  wedge → recovery: a non-chaining voucher is `VoucherInvalid`, then
  `anchor_reset` re-anchors and the same voucher chains (`Ok`).
- **S5/S6** — next: manifests + multi-node 3-space e2e.

## S4 close-protocol conventions (for the S3 driver / S9 runbook)

These are driver/script conventions the bridge code enables; they live in
the bloque repo's driver + runbook (workstream E), recorded here so the
handler contract they rely on is explicit.

- **Quiesce barrier.** `reconcile` demands *identical* voucher sets on both
  sides of a byte-identical window, and it is a bare `Err` with no
  partial/dispute path — one in-flight voucher at close fails *both*
  windows. So the close script must: stop issuing → assert every issued
  `redemption_key` (both directions) appears in the counterpart bridge's
  dedup set (`redeemed_count` + the per-triple check) → `window_rotate`
  both directions → derive claims from the just-closed window's
  `window_net` + the driver's issuer accumulator.
- **Divergence diagnostics.** Commitments are opaque, so a bare
  `NetFlowMismatch` is undebuggable. The `voucher_count` + `rk_set_hash`
  submitted alongside each claim (`clerk-settle::claim_diagnostics`)
  localize a mismatch without opening any commitment: count differs ⇒
  in-flight/missed voucher; count equal but hash differs ⇒ set divergence.
  Recovery is resubmission of a corrected claim (the venue's claim store is
  replace-until-settled), then re-`settle_window`.
- **Wedge recovery.** After a recorded settlement, `anchor_reset(peer,
  settled_closing_root)` on *both* banks' bridges re-opens the voucher
  channels for the next window.
