# VOS runtime v2 contract

VOS v2 assigns one logical JAM service to a root actor and its owned child
tree. The protocol-pinned `vos-service.pvm` is one generic program with the
Gray Paper two-slot entry prologue: Refine begins at instruction counter 0 and
Accumulate at instruction counter 5. Registers `φ[7]`/`φ[8]` remain the
standard argument pointer/length window; they are never VOS phase selectors.
Actor packages contain application PVMs, not application-written Refine or
Accumulate functions.

Refine is pure. A `WorkEnvelopeV2` imports the exact deployment, program,
state, continuation pages, authorization evidence, causal base and referenced
blobs needed to run a slice. Refine may only return a `TransitionV2`; it cannot
write service storage or expose a reply. Identical bytes and execution
semantics produce an identical transition.

Accumulate validates service and ABI identity, the canonical actor
`ProgramId`, authorization, base revision or causal dependencies, blob and
proof availability, and invocation deduplication. It commits state or CRDT
operations, continuations, inbox/outbox rows and the receipt atomically.
Replies, outbound calls and proof packages become visible only after that
commit. A stale linear transition is rejected intact for rescheduling.

## Continuations

An await checkpoint stores the exact nested kernel: each VM's program hash,
PC, registers, heap bounds, gas and lifecycle, mutable capabilities, dirty
page hashes, active/runnable scheduler state, nested call stack and the pending
protocol boundary. Resume consumes the checkpoint, injects one result into its
declared registers and continues at `resume_pc`. It never restarts the handler
at PC 0. Suspended actors are non-reentrant; later messages remain queued.

Every await is a durable slice boundary. Effects before it may commit even if a
later slice fails, so multi-await handlers have saga semantics. Same-tree calls
may execute inline. Cross-root calls always use durable outbox/inbox rows and a
`CallId` derived from `(InvocationId, await ordinal)`.

## Packages and identity

`.vos` v2 packages bind the service ABI, execution-semantics ID, canonical
actor PVM and its `ProgramId`, interfaces, role policies and schemas. Optional
ELF/source-map data is diagnostic only. `DeploymentId` excludes diagnostics
and signatures but includes the authoritative manifest and PVM bytes.
Registries store these bytes and never retranspile an ELF. JIT products,
proving keys and traces are caches keyed by `ProgramId`.

This is a clean storage and wire break. A v1 store or package must be reset and
reinstalled; there is no v1 decoder or migration in a v2 service.

## CRDT boundary

Only `#[actor(crdt)]` packages may select CRDT consistency. Their replicated
fields use explicit `vos::crdt` merge rules (`Value`, `Map`, `Set`, `List`,
`Text`, `Counter`). Stable logical operation IDs and causal metadata replace
wall clocks. The Merkle-DAG supplies causal transport and persistence, not
convergence for arbitrary commands.

Concurrent scalar assignments retain alternatives through `conflicts()` while
choosing the same visible value; counter increments, list and text operations
merge without dropping a DAG branch. Constraints such as uniqueness,
overdraft prevention or irreversible global ordering require Raft or a
purpose-built conflict-free construction.
