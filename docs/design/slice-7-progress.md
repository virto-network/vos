# Slice 7: progress

The log of build step 7, against `slice-7-mobile.md`. Every number is
tagged [measured], [model] or [est]; the research behind the plan is
`research/slice-7/`.

## Step 7.1: the venue side simplified

C6, C1, C4, C8 and C7 (pin D′) at every venue, from vos-core `8b6c9d34`.

**The venue core** (`pvm/proof/anchor/src/venue.rs`, `no_std`): the
registration (`registration`, stateless: 1–16 distinct founding keys, none
of small order, a registrable clock, the founder's strict signature over
`register_digest(venue, space, controller)`; then `register`: a new space,
its first window the venue's next), the anchor rule (`anchor`, answering
`New`, `Again` or `Evidence(held)`, or one of seven refusals), `anchored`,
`expiry`, `fresh`, `aged`, `seen_expiry` and `small_order`, over two
traits (`Roots`, `VenueState: Roots`). Its suite (`vos_anchor::suite`,
feature `suite`) states every rule and refusal once against a `Harness`;
it runs against `ModelVenue`, the Kreivo mock (as a pallet) and the JAM
service (natively, over its storage).

**Every venue calls it:** `ModelVenue` (registration, anchor, anchored);
the Kreivo mock (registration, anchor, anchored, `on_idle`'s `aged`); the
JAM service (refine's registration, accumulate's register, anchor and
anchored over a `Snapshot`); `vos-statement`'s model policy (anchored);
the Kreivo client and jam-dev's client (anchored over what they read). The
`check-venue-rules` recipe, in `just check`, refuses the rule's arithmetic
(`MAX_ROOT_AGE_MS`, `.boundary(`, `verify_strict`, `SMALL_ORDER`) in any
venue's non-test source outside the two verifiers the core is handed, and
requires each venue's call to the core.

**Removed:**
- **Migration (C1):** `Migrate` and `migrate_digest`, `ModelVenue::migrate`,
  the mock's `migrate` (call 5, `end_window`, errors 18, 24, 28, event 5),
  the service's migrate item (tag 1), jam-dev's `migrate`, the e2e's
  migration leg and its `Migrating` client.
- **Resume (C4):** `ModelVenue::resume`, the mock's `resume` (call 6, error
  23, event 9, unblock to `Suspended`), the service's `Resume` control
  (op 2) and its `Suspended` state; slice 6's F3 with them. An equivocation
  now ends the space: status `Ended` (Kreivo index 3, 1 retired), the
  evidence stored, the first root's record kept, the registration deposit
  released, `dispatch_as_sovereign` still callable; the record a tombstone,
  so a replayed registration is `SpaceExists`.
- **A signed start window (C8):** `register_digest` loses `start_window`;
  the mock's `BadStartWindow` (26) and the service's range codes go. The
  space anchors from `now_w + 1` (window 0 before its origin).
- **Rootless and venue-bound statements (C7):** `Pin`, `venue_bound`,
  `Refusal::Venue` (7, retired), the `Venue::id` judge input, the rootless
  `Seen` rule, `wrap-rootless.proof`, the final verifier runner's
  `statements` mode, and their tests and fixture cases.
- **The Kreivo client's anchor-rule checks** (slice 6's F2): `behind()`
  and the window and age checks on the batch thread. The client checks no
  anchor rule; its reads of the space's status, the pause and the listed
  keys stay, as pin D′ keeps them, and spare a fee (`WindowInFuture` →
  again a block later; `Landed` → the record read back).

**Folded:** L4 (strict ed25519 everywhere; a small-order key refused at
registration as `BadGenesis` and when added as `BadAnchorKey` (30), the
G14 and G17 vectors); duplicate founding keys `BadGenesis`; the service's
storage read trapping on an undecodable row (`Storage::corrupt`, a test);
`add_authority` of an authority already `AuthorityExists` (29); item 74
(`vos_venue::forward_venue!`, six wrappers: `Tapped`, `Recorded`,
`Judging`, `Watched`, `Unread`, `Queued`; the seventh, `Migrating`, is
gone); item 29 (the service's control tests split by concern).

**Lines** (`git diff --numstat` from `8b6c9d34`, sources and tests):

| crate | added | removed |
|---|---|---|
| vos-anchor | +748 | −101 |
| vos-statement | +158 | −355 |
| vos-statement-service | +884 | −909 |
| vos-venue | +1,437 | −1,635 |
| vos-node (src) | +14 | −18 |
| vos-node (tests, the e2e among them) | +390 | −676 |
| vos-checker | +4 | −28 |
| vos-jam-dev | +186 | −304 |
| vos-pvm-proof tests | +45 | −238 |
| the fuzz targets | +16 | −34 |
| the final verifier's runner | +1 | −22 |
| the conformance vectors (JSON) | +1,951 | −3,138 |
| `spaces-pallet.md` and other docs | +286 | −247 |

Of vos-anchor's added lines, the core is 345 and its suite 315.

**The vectors, regenerated once:**
- `spaces.json`: G1–G19 → G1–G17 (182 steps → 150). v1's G14 (`migrate`)
  and G19 (`resume`) gone; G15–G18 renumbered G14–G17. Every vector's
  bytes changed (`SpaceInfo` lost `end_window`, `ProgramInfo`
  `venue_bound`); G1, G4, G5, G7, G9, G11 and G14–G17 changed scenario.
  The constants lose `max_root_age_ms`, `min_window_ms`, `max_window_ms`.
- `mutations.json`: the same 416 mutants; those that reached code 7 now
  reach the proof's codes (`0x108`, `0x109`).
- `statements.cases` (19,179 → 14,591 B; the proofs byte-identical):
  "another venue's statement", "replayed at another venue", "migrated
  before a root's window", "registered after a root's window" and the
  rootless replay gone; "rootless, another space" is "rootless" (refused
  4); the rooted replay is "replayed past MaxRootAge". `wrap-rootless.proof`
  (146,052 B) deleted.
- `just conformance` regenerates both files byte for byte.

**Unchanged:** the node's kernels and the agent image
(`the_program_ids_are_the_repositorys` and the pinned image tests pass;
no file under `agent/` or the kernels changed). The statement service's
blob changed, as expected.

**The e2e** (`just e2e-chain`) [measured]: two spaces of three nodes,
one at the Kreivo mock and one at JAM `a`, each registered from window 1;
seven statements accepted at their venues; the JAM space's first statement
refused 5 at Kreivo and at JAM `b`; the reader's rootless `ordered`
refused 4 at JAM `a`; replayed past `MaxRootAge`, 5. Latency 51.7 s at
Kreivo, 85.4–132.9 s at JAM, every one under its gate (189.9–207.7 s);
refine about 79.2–80.3 M gas a statement; Kreivo's sovereign charged 11.5
UNITS (9 anchors, 2 submits, one deposit forfeited); the audit clean over
398 carriers; 1,051 s.

**Gates:** `just check` (the new `check-venue-rules` in it) green; `just
conformance` byte for byte; `just e2e-chain` green.

**Where the plan was off:**
- The fixtures' `statements.cases` regenerated here, not first at 7.8a:
  the policy's encoding lost the venue and the cases with it. Only the
  cases file changed; the proofs are byte-identical, so the program ids
  and the kit's proofs hold.
- The e2e could not keep one space across both venues once migration
  went: it runs two spaces, one at each.
- C2's half on the pallet (an authority's key set once, `AuthorityExists`)
  landed here, so the vectors regenerate once; the node's side stays 7.2's.
- `BadClock` before the origin and `OutOfRange` merged into the core's
  refusals: an anchor before the space's first window is
  `WindowNotAfterLast`, one before its origin `WindowInFuture`.

### The review's fixes

Fable's review (`research/slice-7/7.1-fable.md`: fix, then merge), folded
as further commits:
- **M1:** the anchor rule judges a window's age before its held root, so
  a second root at an aged window is `Age` whether or not the venue has
  pruned the first; only a fresh window's second root is evidence. A suite
  case pins it at the three venues. `spaces.json`'s G4 changed (its stale
  and before-the-first refusals had sat at aged windows; they now sit at
  fresh ones, and G4 gains the aged second root, `WindowTooOld`, the space
  active); G5, G16 and every other vector are byte-identical, and
  `mutations.json` is unchanged.
- **M2:** `proving.md` (§3.6's statement rules, §6's venues, §7's
  equivocation and one venue, A.6's fixture tables) and
  `clerk-across-spaces.md` follow pin D′.
- **M3:** one venue a space is the space's discipline, which no venue
  enforces: a founder may register the same genesis at two venues, and
  with the same roots a statement is handled at both, with different
  roots the space forks unseen. Stated in `vos-statement`'s crate doc,
  `spaces-pallet.md` §0, §6.2 and §6.3, pin D′'s C1 bullet and
  `simplify.md` C1 (an erratum).
- **L1:** JAM's refine judges an anchor's signature before the state
  checks; a suite case takes an anchor failing both its key and its
  signature as refused by either, and refine's doc and `spaces-pallet.md`
  §6.1 say so.
- **L2:** the key-listing rule is the core's `venue::add_key` (small order,
  listed, at most `MAX_FOUNDING_KEYS`), which the model, the service's
  `AddKey` and the mock's `add_authority` call; a suite case fills a space's
  keys; the mock's `MaxAnchorKeys` is the kit's constant.
- **L3:** `check-venue-rules` also refuses `registrable`, the window
  lengths, the key bound, `small_order(` and comparisons with the last
  window anchored, now over jam-dev's commands too, and requires each
  venue's `add_key`. It caught the two clients' settled check comparing
  with the last window itself; both now ask the core (`venue::passed`).
  The clients' sanctioned status and key reads are not flagged.
- **L5:** the record's line on the Kreivo client corrected (above).
- **L6:** `spaces-pallet.md` §9's rotation and hand-back language left for
  7.2's doc pass.
- The statement model's policy says why its spaces read active from window
  0.

**Not to run alone (L4):** until 7.2, the representative's leader signs its
own cut's root (`node/host/src/leader/anchor.rs`), with no replicated
anchor row and no divergence guard. A deposed leader whose close was not
committed and a successor can sign two roots for one window: under 7.1
that honest double-sign ends the space for good. 7.1 lands with 7.2, never
alone, before any space whose state matters runs on it.

**Gates after the fixes:** `just check` green (`check-venue-rules`: 44
files, 18 calls); `just conformance` byte for byte; `just e2e-chain` green
again [measured]: 1,036 s, the same verdicts, latency 47.5 s at Kreivo and
60.8–109.0 s at JAM, each under its gate; the audit clean over 398
carriers.
