# Slice 7: progress

The log of build step 7, against `slice-7-mobile.md`. Every number is
tagged [measured], [model] or [est]; the research behind the plan is
`research/slice-7/`.

## Step 7.0: the docs, the picks and two probes

### 7.0: the docs

- **This log,** opened in `slice-6-progress.md`'s shape.
- **`proving.md`:**
  - §8's masking floor: a floor per masked component set by the queries
    (2^12 rows at blowup 2 with 86–87 queries, 2^11 at blowup 4 with 43,
    2^10 at blowup 8 with 29; half for a component with no next-row read),
    not "2^11" (`research/slice-7/device-params.md`);
  - §8's "a real phone, early", and §10's ARM-factor risk, retired by the
    Fairphone 6 run (`research/slice-7/phone-fairphone6-s5kit.txt`);
  - §11's slice-7 rows: M3.9 added (11.5–18 weeks), M4 and M5 as the plan
    builds them (12.5–18 and 22–33.5 weeks, 26–39.5 with word-level
    memory), M6 moved past slice 7 (S1); the total replaced by slice 7's
    52–77 engineer-weeks, up to 83; decision 8 and §10's signature-chip
    row say where M6 went.
- **`core-model.md`:** draft 6, with "Changes from draft 5" naming what
  slice 6 built into it (`338e70df`): slice 6's L8.
- **The decisions:** `owner-decisions.md` (S1–S33) and the plan's
  "Decisions" agree; the plan now names S11's and S25's amendments in
  full (the deposit released on `Ended`, `member` without an epoch) and
  the vectors S10 changes in part (G1, G18).

### 7.0a: the device baseline on today's AIR

**Built** (`spikes/s7-device`, throwaway):
- **`guest/`:** a test actor whose attestable `auth` is the statement:
  the member's row in a vos-tree of 10^6 rows (BLAKE2b, salted values,
  the agent root's format) checked against the map's root from its
  encoded multiproof, its value committing to the secret; the output the
  nullifier for a scope; root, scope and binding `#[public]`, so the
  io-hash states them as pin I's auth words do. Derived as a node derives
  it, arguments through the witness input: **19,192 steps**, one segment,
  981 B of input, a 795 B path [measured]. Slice 5's kernel took 12,951
  steps on the pre-hardening AIR with arguments in memory.
- **`harness/`:** the kernel traced by `trace_kernel` and proved whole by
  `prove_shaped` at the run's natural log sizes, under a format the
  process admits under the device number (37): the Blake2s channel, the
  cell's blowup, queries and PoW, interaction PoW 8. Shapes:
  - `built`: the derived shape's 23 chips, verified by
    `verify_standalone`;
  - `floor`: the page-Merkle boundary chips out, the memory ledger's
    boundary entries for accessed bytes only (slice 5's floor seam): pin
    J's shape as a cost proxy (its relations do not balance; not
    verified); 19 chips;
  - `lean`: the floor without BLAKE2b and its AND table, lever 1's shape
    without the Poseidon2 chip that replaces them; 17 chips.
- **The masked-cost proxy:** `masked0` commits every chip one log size
  up (so the composition two up), as the plan states it; `masked12` and
  `masked11` first pad every chip to the floor masking (c) needs at the
  cell's parameters (2^12 at 86 queries, 2^11 at 43). Chips whose size
  their content fixes (the tables, the program, the 16-row boundaries)
  refuse another size and stay: the harness counts what (c) would commit
  with them padded and raised too, and the proxy holds 98–99% of it.
- **`pvm-proof.patch`,** applied only in the copy of the tree
  `scripts/tree.sh` exports (never in the repository): the Blake2s stack
  routed in `with_stack!`, a format the process installs under a
  registered number, and the memory chip's floor seam.

**The proxy, read right** (the review's L11): it raises the trace heights,
so it pays the doubled evaluation domain in full, the Merkle hashing of
the doubled leaf layer included, and constraint evaluation over twice the
rows. It omits what masking adds beyond the domain: the randomizer's
sampling, the salts, R2's blinding, the FRI mask's columns and R1's
retries, and the wrap's lifting. A floor on the masking factor, not an
estimate.

**Measured on x86** (Core Ultra 7 155H, glibc; 4 threads pinned to four
P-cores, 8 threads over the six P-cores' twelve; median of 5; the machine
shared with another agent, load 1.2–5.2, so ±10% and one cell noted)
[measured, `spikes/s7-device/runs/x86.jsonl`, `x86-lean.jsonl`]:

| floor, 2:38:20 (the kit's) | 0.84 s | 0.73 s | 1,242 MiB | 1,094,992 | | 47.9M |

Configurations are log blowup : queries : PoW. Cells count every committed
column (preprocessed, main, interaction) times its rows, before blowup.

- **Today's AIR against slice 5's:** at the kit's configuration the floor
  proves in the same 0.84 s (4,975 columns against 4,655), the built shape
  in 2.62 s against 1.72 s (more steps: the witness-input prologue, the
  return's encoding and the io-hash).
- **Verified:** every built proof at 86, 87 and 43 queries, in 21–37 ms
  on x86. The kit's 2:38:20 is refused by today's verifier before any
  cryptographic work: 96 conjectured bits, under the floor of 100.
- **Threads:** 8 threads run from 10% slower to 20% faster than 4 on this
  shared machine; the phone's split is P1's.

**The masked proxy's factor** (proxy over plain, same cell, median)
[measured]:

| shape | 1:86:20, masked12 | 1:86:20, masked0 | 2:43:20, masked11 | 2:43:20, masked0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| built | ×2.39 (4) / ×1.89 (8) | ×2.26 / ×1.81 | ×2.05 / ×1.76 | ×2.03 / ×1.70 |
| floor | ×2.09 / ×1.84 | ×2.07 / ×1.86 | ×3.37 (noisy) / ×1.84 | ×2.15 / ×1.80 |
| lean | ×1.85 / ×1.52 | | ×1.89 / ×1.73 | |

So the masking factor on this shape is **at least about ×1.8–2.1** (×1.5–2.4
over all cells), with the cells ×2.0–2.1 and peak memory ×1.9–2.0. The
wrap's measured ×2.6–2.9 is the reference for what masking adds beyond
the proxy; on the segment chips the factor lies between, at ×1.8–2.9
[est].

**Blowup 2 against 4:** at the device candidates, blowup 2 with 86
queries proves in ×0.75–0.78 of blowup 4 with 43 (floor and lean,
plain and proxy, 4 threads), against slice 5's ×0.8 [measured].

**Bytes against pin J's 1.5 MiB (1,572,864 B)** [measured; postcard]:

| shape | 1:86:20 | 1:87:20 | 1:86:20, proxy | 2:43:20 | 2:43:20, proxy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| built | 3,538,744 (×2.25) | 3,577,588 | 3,585,415 | 1,893,890 (×1.20) | 1,928,527 |
| floor | 2,245,957 (×1.43) | 2,271,916 | 2,292,090 | 1,217,153 (×0.77) | 1,243,059 |
| lean | 948,004 (×0.60) | | 988,651 | 536,273 (×0.34) | 561,297 |

- **On today's floor, blowup 2 does not fit:** 2.25–2.27 MB at 86–87
  queries, ×1.43 the budget before masking. Blowup 4 with 43 fits (1.22
  MB) unmasked; masked at the wrap's ×1.31 it would be about 1.6 MB
  [est], just past it.
- **Without BLAKE2b** (lever 1) blowup 2 fits: 0.95 MB, about 1.1 MB with
  the Poseidon2 chip's ~300 columns [est], 1.1–1.45 MB masked (the proxy's
  ×1.02 to the wrap's ×1.31) [est]. So pin J's blowup-2 candidate depends
  on lever 1 landing first.
- The proxy adds 1–2% to the bytes (one more Merkle level a path); the
  masking's own columns and salts are what the wrap's ×1.31 measured.

**The PoW grind** (Blake2s-M31 channel, 128 grinds a cell, x86)
[measured]: PoW 20 median 40 ms, 95th percentile 48 ms on 4 threads (63
and 79 ms on 8, under load); PoW 16 5 and 12 ms (8 and 16 on 8). On the
phone about 0.12–0.14 s median at PoW 20 [est, ×3–3.5], inside every
proving time above and untouched by the levers.

**Peak memory against pin J's 1 GiB:** the masked floor needs 1.5–2.4 GiB
on x86, the masked lean shape 1.25 GiB at blowup 2 (1.9 GiB at 4); the
phone's mimalloc build runs about 15% above [measured, slice 5]. Memory
tracks the cells, so the CPU-side levers (3, 6, 5) bring it under 1 GiB
only together: about 0.5–0.75 GiB after levers 3 and 6 [est].

**Phone binaries** (session P1): `spikes/s7-device/phone-dist/`,
`s7-phone-timing` and `s7-phone-seeded`, static aarch64-musl, 9.0 MB each
(SHA-256 in `s7-phone.sha256`, the x86 proofs' in `x86-references.txt`),
built by `scripts/phone.sh`; the runbook is `phone-dist/runbook.md`.
Under qemu-aarch64 every P1 cell's proof from the seeded build is
byte-identical to x86's and the built proof verifies; the timing build's
proofs too (nothing is masked in 7.0a) [measured,
`runs/qemu-seeded-p1.jsonl`, `runs/qemu-timing.jsonl`].

**On the phone:** pending P1.

**M5's outlook, redone** [est, from the x86 cells above and slice 5's
phone ratio; P1 replaces the ratio]. The phone at automatic threads is
taken at 2.6–3.0× x86 on four P-cores (the kit's: built 5.1 s against 1.72
s, the floor 2.2 s against 0.84 s). The grind (about 0.13 s) is taken out
before the levers' factors and added back:

| | factor | time on the phone | basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| today's floor, masked proxy, blowup 2, 86 queries | | 3.5–4.0 s | x86 1.33 s [measured] |
| lever 1: BLAKE2b and its AND table gone (the lean shape) | ×0.67 | 2.3–2.7 s | x86 0.89 s [measured proxy]; the Poseidon2 chip not counted |
| masking beyond the proxy | ×1.0–1.4 | 2.3–3.7 s | the proxy ×1.8–2.1 is a floor, the wrap's ×2.6–2.9 the reference |
| lever 2: threads by core class | ×0.9 | 2.1–3.4 s | [measured, slice 5: 2–9%] |
| lever 3: a lean kernel | ×0.55–0.7 | 1.2–2.4 s | [model, slice 5] |
| lever 6: the CPU split | ×0.65–0.75 | 0.8–1.8 s | [model] |
| lever 5: word-level memory | ×0.88–0.92 | **0.75–1.7 s** | [model]; the grind's 0.13 s included |

- **Against the old outlook** (0.7–1.5 s): the favourable end holds; the
  unfavourable end rises to about 1.7 s, the blowup-2 gain being in the
  starting cell already and the masking's factor still a range. **1 s
  remains reachable only at the favourable end, after levers 1–3 and the
  CPU split**, as draft 4 said.
- **The 95th percentile** adds about 0.05–0.2 s of grind tail [est]; PoW
  16 (95 queries at blowup 2, about 10% more bytes) makes the grind about
  0.02 s.
- **Two more constraints the cells show:** the blowup-2 candidate fits
  1.5 MiB only once BLAKE2b is gone; peak memory under 1 GiB needs the
  CPU-side levers, not only lever 1.
- **For the owner (S20):** after P1 measures the ratio on today's AIR, the
  gate stays at ≤ 1 s or is set from the measured range.

### 7.0b: the passkey PRF on the gate device

Pending P1.
