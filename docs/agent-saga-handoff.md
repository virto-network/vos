# Agent saga review handoff — 2026-09-15

## Checkpoint and decision

Implementation checkpoint: `f76dabe1` on `wip/ch08-runtime-directory`.
At that checkpoint, `saga/agents` is `31b0cdbb`: 258 commits ahead, zero behind,
221 changed files, 71,025 insertions and 58,780 deletions. These counts exclude
this documentation handoff. Both worktrees were clean when inspected.

The checkpoint is available for review and isolated, disposable Local-space
testing. It is **not master-ready or production-ready**. No merge, push,
history rewrite, or release-gate waiver is part of this handoff. Existing data
must not be relabelled across the intentional r16/r17 clean break.

## Three review areas, not three completed batches

Keep the agreed C1/C2/C3 grouping. Internal checkpoint commits are not additional
review endpoints. The current integrated history has not yet been consolidated
into three independently verified commit ranges; do not assume that selecting
commits by title produces independently usable branches.

| Area | Review focus | Still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C1 — recovery | Host-owned management evidence, physical checkpoint/GC/reopen, opaque-runtime Local lifecycle and portable recovery. | Remaining cross-runtime and positive-ack retirement coverage; preserve the distinction between scripted host-ABI tests and actual guest execution. |
| C2 — native lifecycle | Durable authorization/issuance/application/acknowledgement, native Local Create/Install, bundled system actors, first-up ingress, exact retry and restart. | Acceptable latency; authenticated reclamation beyond the 256 issued-record ceiling; ordinary Shared-agent finality; broader expiry/abort, mixed-pending and profile recovery. |
| C3 — release | Source/bundle identity, independent artifact reproduction, feature/no_std checks, docs/examples, physical and inventory qualification. | Final-source full regression and release matrix, required profile gates and fresh-space smoke after implementation closure; final scoped review ranges. |

The detailed requirements remain in [the current closeout plan](agent-saga-review.md#current-closeout-plan).
This handoff does not narrow them. Review C1/C2 implementation now; C3 cannot
certify release readiness while those implementation gates remain open.

## What has usable evidence

- Matching r17 runtime/system-template bundles were independently reproduced.
  Fresh bootstrap/restart and HTTP/SSH have passed.
- Local Create/Install exact recovery, Counter mutation, exact retries and
  restart reads have passed. Initial Create/Install HTTP 504s remain failures
  of first-response usability; successful recovery does not erase them.
- At `4e8aa893`, the broad optimized library run reported 1,813 passed,
  20 failed and three ignored. All 20 socket-dependent failures passed
  socket-enabled reruns. The ignored native-capacity test passed separately;
  the other two ignored tests were diagnostic probes. This is evidence across
  several commands, not a single green full-suite run.
- After the nested decoder changes at `d2aa1efe`, 74 focused tests passed in
  both debug and release. The full library suite was not rerun on that source.
- At `f76dabe1`, the CLI check and production-profile build passed. The release
  restart passed HTTP status, byte-identical SSH host key and clean shutdown.
  This reused a retained disposable fixture; it was not a new-space test.

## Performance: measured facts and remaining uncertainty

Repeated authenticated history validation can rehash embedded artifact blobs.
A resolved library-test stack reached that work through capacity admission:
`reserve_projection_pair` → `audit_recovery_capacity` → physical-row validation
→ journal/runtime-work decoding → availability validation → BLAKE2.
This is a confirmed expensive path, not proof that it explains all daemon time.

Removing redundant nested validation preserves public constructed-value
validation, physical integrity checks and canonical encoding checks. On the
same copied 46-row, 33,750,544-byte history, the ABBA comparison measured median
decode time of **366.874 ms before versus 141.168 ms after** (about 62% lower).
There is no cross-observation validation cache and no bypass of authentication.

The latest `f76dabe1` release restart took **159 seconds**:

| Measured stage | Duration |
| --- | ---: |
| System-owner open/recovery | 95.515 s |
| Inventory reconciliation | 59.784 s |
| Of that reconciliation: inventory loading | 56.712 s |

The inventory figure includes authenticated queries, not just reading a local
table. Earlier release restarts took 99, 112 and 125 seconds, but retained
history changes between runs: these are not a controlled before/after series.
The decoder benchmark has **not** established acceptable startup or operation
latency. The internal split of system-owner recovery remains unmeasured.

Post-checkpoint diagnostic preparation adds debug-only cumulative owner-stage
timings for record/issuer validation, genesis preparation/archive reproduction,
Shared host open/provision, committed-entry draining, pending-projection recovery,
network attachment, and Authority/Catalog checks. Only static phase names and
elapsed milliseconds are logged; no payloads or identity material are added.
`cargo check --locked -p vosx` passed in 5.35 seconds with warnings. These new
markers were subsequently measured at `824b2c9c`, as below. Successive cumulative
timestamps must be subtracted to obtain each stage's duration.

### Owner-stage measurement at `824b2c9c`

The locked production-profile CLI build passed in 6m45s. A release restart of
the original disposable r17 fixture passed HTTP status, unchanged SSH identity
and clean shutdown, but readiness took **183 seconds** (09:57:13–10:00:16 UTC).
Within this run:

| Stage | Duration |
| --- | ---: |
| Owner record/issuer through genesis/archive preparation | 0.174 s |
| Shared host open, including committee binding before the marker | 119.009 s |
| System bootstrap provisioning | 0.784 s |
| Explicit post-open committed-entry drain and pending-projection check | about 0.001 s |
| Network attachment | 2.235 s |
| Authority/Catalog checks after attachment | 0.202 s |
| Inventory reconciliation | 56.682 s |

The dominant owner interval is `SharedAgentHost::open_with_root`, not genesis
preparation or the explicit post-open drain. Its internal replay/verification
split still needs measurement; this does not show that replay itself is cheap,
because reopening the host includes recovery. Retained history differs from
earlier runs, so 183 seconds is not an optimization comparison.

A preceding raw-copy probe failed with `Host(CorruptResidue)` before host open
completed; networking also reported sandbox `Operation not permitted`. Source
inspection found that the outer lease commits to the absolute host path and
the authority namespace is derived from that path. Relocating a directory copy
is not a supported reopen fixture. Neither copy nor original was repaired or
cleared. The successful probe instead used socket permission at the original
fixture path and therefore could advance that fixture's authenticated history.
The raw copy's Raft DB initially matched the original at SHA256
`ddef123679ad07d43c374f0340f14f36b4462a11642f2bd57bc7f750063a4a6a`;
matching bytes alone does not preserve the outer lease's path binding.

Next performance work should measure that owner stage internally on fixed
history, then address the measured repeated work while preserving recovery
proofs. Do not clear history, increase timeouts, skip checks, or infer that
retirement alone permits deleting issuer/coordinator records.

The next diagnostic source adds cumulative debug timings in
`SharedAgentHost::open_generation` for journal-store opening, Raft ledger,
artifact store, journal driver and exposure/restore. Nested driver timings
separate artifact audit, committee history, executor setup, materialization,
profile/ledger audit, reconciliation and final reverified-open bookkeeping.
Enable `vos::agent::shared_host=debug` and
`vos::agent::shared_journal_driver=debug` in addition to the prior modules.
These markers have only a CLI check pass (5.28 seconds, with warnings), not a
release timing result. Its log is `owner-startup-phases.5se4bH/shared-open-check.log`.
Source inspection shows `audit_recovery` is invoked by ledger opening,
committee-history loading and journal auditing. Their duration and safe scope
for reuse are not yet established; no audit was removed or cached.

### Replay attribution at `f2b17cb2`

The locked release CLI build passed in 6m35s. The original-path r17 restart
passed HTTP status, unchanged SSH identity and clean shutdown in **54 seconds**
(10:10:20–10:11:14 UTC). This was instrumentation-only source, not a performance
fix. The retained suffix started at **7 rows**, versus **85** in the preceding
183-second run. That prior log shows 92 rows at 09:59:55.374682, zero at
09:59:55.731954, and seven at shutdown. The shorter restart must not be
attributed to the new timing markers. The capacity-triggered certified
checkpoint path is present in `query_authority`; the row-count transition is
consistent with that path, not evidence of manual history deletion.

Measured generation-open durations on the seven-row suffix:

| Stage | Duration |
| --- | ---: |
| Journal-store opening | 44 ms |
| Raft ledger opening | 24 ms |
| Artifact-store opening | below 1 ms timer resolution |
| Journal driver total | 8,054 ms |
| Within driver: `materialize_current` replay | 7,898 ms |
| Within driver: committee history | 19 ms |
| Within driver: profile/ledger audit | 56 ms |
| Within driver: cross-store reconciliation | 80 ms |
| Exposure/restore after driver | 43 ms |
| Inventory reconciliation after owner startup | 41,798 ms |

In the earlier 119.009-second host-open interval, the three completed recovery
audits total only 847,082 microseconds (299,300 + 251,223 + 296,559). Auditing
therefore does not account for most of that interval. The new run directly
locates most driver-open time in replay; attributing the earlier interval to
replay is an inference from the call order and audit timestamps, not a direct
replay timing on the same 85-row history.

Next work should focus on replay execution and safe certified-checkpoint policy,
while separately addressing inventory-query execution. Do not remove audit
checks based on the earlier BLAKE2 sample: the sample and decoding benchmark
identify real work but do not explain most startup latency. Both builds and
the startup probe are terminal; no process remains to poll. Evidence is in
`shared-reopen-phases.LP4zS4/{build.log,run.log,up.log}`, with the probe script,
HTTP status and SSH-key evidence alongside them.

### Physical runtime attribution without another rebuild

The same `f2b17cb2` release executable, with the existing
`vos::agent::local_journal_driver=debug` timer enabled, passed original-path
startup/HTTP/SSH/shutdown in **75 seconds** (10:14:33–10:15:48 UTC). Its retained
suffix started at 20 rows, so this is again not a fixed-history comparison.

Between the driver `executor_setup` and `materialize_current` markers, replay
took **25,048 ms**. Eighteen `physical Agent runtime execution` records total
**24,304,768 microseconds**, approximately **97%** of replay time. The timer
includes `RefineContext::load` and `.run`, not just interpreted instructions;
it excludes the subsequent bounded output decode. Call inputs were roughly
789–793 KB, with alternating calls using about 933 million and 500 million gas.
This establishes physical runtime load/run as the dominant measured replay
cost, not repeated host-side ledger auditing. It does not yet separate loading,
outer-runtime execution, nested actor execution or specific guest functions.

Inventory reconciliation took **44,935 ms**, including **42,885 ms** loading
inventory. The next implementation investigation should target runtime-call
cost (and distinguish load from execution if needed), while preserving guest
semantics, exact outputs and gas accounting. More aggressive checkpointing
could limit replay length but would not by itself fix expensive live queries.
No cache, checkpoint-policy change, timeout change or new artifact pin was made.
Logs, script and HTTP/SSH evidence are in `runtime-replay-timings.J9kxo3/`.
The probe exited zero and its daemon is stopped.

## Local evidence and resumption

Evidence is on disk under `.worktrees/ch08-c2-native/target/task-tmp/`, not `/tmp`:

- `decoder-fixed-history.Q5oYmW/`: `comparison.log`, paired baseline/candidate
  logs, `candidate-release-regressions.log`, `startup-phase-check.log`,
  `startup-phase-build.log`, `startup-phases-run.log`, `startup-phases-up.log`,
  status response and SSH-key comparison inputs.
- `r17-startup-smoke.ncMr4z/`: `final-source-release-library.log`,
  `final-source-network-sockets.log`, `final-source-merge-socket.log`,
  `final-source-node-socket.log`, and `final-source-native-capacity.log`.
- `owner-startup-phases.5se4bH/`: `build.log`, failed relocated-copy `run.log`
  and `up.log`, successful `original-run.log` and `original-up.log`, HTTP/SSH
  evidence and both probe scripts. The successful probe exited zero; neither
  probe remains running.

These are local evidence paths, not committed or portable release artifacts.
Preserve the fixture's config/locks authority stores as well as its data,
retained requests and logs. The latest smoke completed and stopped its daemon;
its session handle is no longer live. Do not restart it merely to poll status.

Before integration, inspect the complete diff and dependencies and establish
the three review boundaries without rewriting the existing implementation
branch. Before master, close every open requirement in the closeout plan and
qualify the final source, not just this checkpoint's focused tests.
