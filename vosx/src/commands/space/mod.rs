//! `vosx space *` — per-space lifecycle, daemon control,
//! and registry-mediated agent management.
//!
//! Three groups of commands:
//!
//! - **Offline**: `new`, `list`, `info`, `join`, `delete`,
//!   `export` (read-only). Operate on `~/.config/vosx/spaces.toml`
//!   and per-space data dirs without contacting a daemon.
//! - **Daemon**: `up` runs the libp2p server that owns the
//!   redb. One daemon per space, identified by an
//!   `<data_dir>/.endpoint` file.
//! - **Client**: `publish`, `install`, `upgrade`, `uninstall`,
//!   `unpublish`, `programs`, `agents`, `members`, `call`.
//!   Each spawns a tiny libp2p peer, dials the daemon's
//!   endpoint, sends one registry invoke, and exits. Same
//!   plumbing under `DaemonClient` — `call` is the floor
//!   primitive, the rest are typed sugar.
